# CS371-Final-Project

Movie recommendation algorithm using knowledge representation and reasoning

## Getting Started

This project sources its data from the The Movie Database (TMDb). To access the API as efficiently as possible we made use of the tmdbsimple Python module which can be downloaded as such:

`pip install tmdbsimple`

Likewise, one must get an API key from the TMDb website and store it in a file "apiconfig.py" in the main directory. This file should contain one line looking like:

`API_KEY = <<your api key>>`

API keys can be obtained [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).
